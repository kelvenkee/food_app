## Project Title: Food Ordering Application

## Project Synopsis:
    The motivation of this project is to develop a food ordering application that can be used to revolutionize the traditional ordering system that is currently implemented in the majority of the food and beverage industry. The application are designed in order to provide convenience for both employees and consumers. Consumers are able to view the food menu of the restaurant and  order their food and drinks through the application. The food order will be sent to the employees application simultaneously. While for the employees, employees are able to create, read, update and delete the food menu of the restaurant, as well as create, read, update and delete the food order received from the consumers. 
    The integration of the application is by using Firebase online databases to manage the data. It will load up the data into the application when there is an active internet connection. Firebase is also used for managing the authentication in the application as only the administration and employee of the restaurant is holding the access to managing the food menu and food order.
